			<div class="col-sm-10">[Intro: Swae Lee] Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy (Ooh) Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (Ooh) Ayy, ayy Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh <br>
			[Verse 1: Swae Lee] Needless to say, I keep in check She was a bad-bad, nevertheless (Yeah) Callin' it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck (Wreck) Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck (Wreck) Needless to say, I'm keeping in check She was a bad-bad, nevertheless Callin' it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck Thinkin' in a bad way, losin' your grip Screamin' at my face, baby, don't trip Someone took a big L, don't know how that felt Lookin' at you sideways, party on tilt Ooh-ooh, some things you just can't refuse She wanna ride me like a cruise and I'm not tryna lose <br>
			[Chorus: Swae Lee] Then you're left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya You're a sunflower, I think your love would be too much Or you'll be left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya You're the sunflower, you're the sunflower <br>
			[Verse 2: Post Malone] Every time I'm leavin' on ya (Ooh) You don't make it easy, no (No, no) Wish I could be there for ya (Ooh) Give me a reason to, oh (Oh) Every time I'm walkin' out (Oh) I can hear you tellin' me to turn around (Oh, oh) Fightin' for my trust and you won't back down (No) Even if we gotta risk it all right now, oh (Now) I know you're scared of the unknown (Known) You don't wanna be alone (Alone) I know I always come and go (And go) But it's out of my control <br>
			[Chorus: Post Malone] And you'll be left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya You're the sunflower, I think your love would be too much Or you'll be left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya You're the sunflower, you're the sunflower (Yeah)</div>
